# -Automated-Pipeline-for-KSE-100-Stock-Data
This project automates the scraping, preprocessing, and storage of historical stock data for KSE-100 companies from 2008 to 2024. Using Python, the data is extracted directly from the PSX portal with options for monthly or specific date retrieval. Preprocessing involves cleaning and standardizing data using Python techniques, ensuring integration with additional Kaggle datasets. The processed data is stored in a database, supporting scalable financial analysis and predictive modeling. This efficient pipeline offers a robust framework for continuous data management and analysis in the financial domain.
